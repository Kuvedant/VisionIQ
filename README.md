# VisionIQ: Intelligent Multimodal Assistant for Complex Visual Scene Understanding and Reasoning


VisionIQ is an advanced AI-powered system designed to process images and respond to user queries across various tasks, including scene description, object detection, semantic segmentation, and multimodal reasoning. By leveraging cutting-edge vision-language models (VLMs), large vision models (LVMs), and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, VisionIQ delivers detailed and contextually relevant insights across multiple domains such as healthcare, e-commerce, urban planning, and more.

## Features

### 1. Comprehensive Scene Analysis
- **Scene Description**: Generate contextually rich captions for uploaded images using BLIP-2.
- **Object Detection**: Identify and localize objects in images with YOLOv5.
- **Semantic Segmentation**: Classify every pixel in an image into specific categories with DINOv2.
- **Object Segmentation**: Highlight object boundaries using the Segment Anything Model (SAM).

### 2. Contextual Multimodal Reasoning
- Utilize a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to answer complex queries requiring both textual and visual understanding.

### 3. Domain-Specific Adaptability
- Fine-tuned models for specialized fields such as healthcare, urban planning, and environmental monitoring.

### 4. Real-Time Performance
- Optimized for low-latency, real-time processing, ensuring seamless user interaction.
